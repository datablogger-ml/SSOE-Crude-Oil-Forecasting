# SSOE-Crude-Oil-Forecasting
Worked on coming up with analytical solutions for SSOE Trading team for Crude Oil Forecasting.

1. Crude Oil 1 day ahead Forecasting based on different metrics for SSOE
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Finding relationships between variables, outlier detection, plotting graphs of those relationships, correlations and preparing final data for modelling
3. Time Series Univariate Models : ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters
4. Multivariate Regression Models : Random Forest, XgBoost
5. HyperParameter Optimization : Finding the best parameters using RandomSearch, HyperOpt
6. Forecasting accuracy of 97% and a Directional accuracy of 55%
7. Twitter Based News Analytics to find the market sentiment of crude oil for the next day
8. Using libraries like GetOldTweets3, Python-Twitter to fetch historical Tweet data to train classifier models (LSTM, GRU)
9. Unsupervised techniques like Word Cloud and Topic Modelling for Twitter Data visualization
1. Deliver consistently on individual analytic projects/sub-part of large analytic projects.
2. Understanding of analytical tools and techniques and the ability to apply the relevant tool/technique to the given business problem.
3. Assess the effectiveness and accuracy of new data sources and data gathering techniques.
4. Gather requirements from stakeholders, and translate the business problem to an analytics problem.
5. Coordinate with functional teams and peers to process data and create implementation plan.
6. Develop business context and knowledge.
7. Python based libraries for Forecasting, Natural Language Processing, Cloud analytics, GPU based computing etc.
